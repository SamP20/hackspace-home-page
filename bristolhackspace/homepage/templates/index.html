<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Bristol Hackspace is a place to make things; a community of like-minded individuals centered around our space in St Philips.</p>

<p>Our space has plenty of tools and equipment, from saws and drills to a laser cutter and 3D printer, and all sorts of components, salvaged stuff and donated bits and bobs. If you have an idea for a project, want to learn new skills and have a lot of fun doing it, or just fancy a chat â€“ <a href="{{ url_for('registration') }}">join us!</a></p>
